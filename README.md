## 📬 Contact Form

The contact form is set up to send submissions via an external form handler. If you wish to make the form fully functional under your own email/service:

1. Replace the form service URL/action in `contact.html` with your preferred form endpoint (e.g., FormSubmit, Google Forms, or a custom backend).
2. Test form submission and confirmation messages.
